# Usage Logger 2

## Introduction
Usage Logger 2 is an Android app that records or extracts data about how a person uses their smartphone. Primarily developed to assist with psychological research and behavioural science more generally, the app can be configured to perform a number of different functions. This includes the ability to extract information about previous (retrospective) usage (max. 5 days) as well as current usage of the phone.

## FAQ

### Do I need to use the decryption website?
You donâ€™t need to use the decrypting website, if you open the encrypted PDF files with the correct password. However, we have created a website that will automatically decrypt and convert PDF files into CSV files for your convenience. PDF files are used as this allows participants to view their own data on their device at any time.
