        <h3>Who is collecting the data?</h3>
        <p>The application was primarily designed so that it would be useful for psychological research. However, usage data can be collected for any purpose. The usage data collected will only be accessible by others if the end user chooses to share the encrypted file and accompanying password.</p>

        <h3>What data is being collected?</h3>
        <p>Usage Logger collects three types of data. Data regarding what the person had used their phone for in the past (up to 5 days in the past). This will include when the phone screen was on and what apps were employed, other data is captured by the app but this resembles noise about the internal operations of the phone. Data regarding the context of which the file is used, this. It can collect what apps are installed, the permissions requested by these apps and the reaction of these apps. Finally, the prospective file will include data on when the phone is off/on. It can also include when the screen is on/off, when apps are employed and the associated identity of those apps, when notifications are sent/deleted and which apps generated the apps also if there are any changes in the apps which are installed on the device. What the app does collect is dependent on the QR code provided to the user. Once the user has scanned a QR code to participate in an experiment they will be informed prior to data collection beginning what data will be collected from their device.</p>

        <h3>How secure is the data?</h3>
        <p>The data is far more secure than the Standard Android security protocols. A security key is used to protect the data, this is generated through utilising user generated randomness. This key is then stored in an encrypted file, only accessible to the app. The files associated with the data are protected with a SHA 256 bit encryption. IMPORTANT – Android users with rooted phones or who have reason to believe that they have compromised security should not use this application. We will also notify the user of this prior to data collection. It is the users responsibility to ensure the integrity of their smartphone security before installing this application.</p>

        <h3>What is the legal bias for processing the data?</h3>
        <p>The data will only be accessible to researchers when a user has sent encrypted files and an accompanying password. This is interpreted as giving consent to process the data for the purposes of scientific research. IMPORTANT FOR USERS AND RESEARCHERS – Files and passwords should not be sent in the same email.</p>

        <h3>Will the data collected be shared with the third parties?</h3>
        <p>The user has complete control over who has access to their data. We do not use a server and therefore have no method of accessing the data on their phone. They must export the file and their password to the intended recipient in order to provide access.</p>

        <h3>How will the information be used?</h3>
        <p>The data collected is intended to be used by scientists who are attempting to better understand how individual and group movements relate to other scientific phenomena. We strongly discourage anyone not engaging in scientific research not to use this app.</p>

        <h3>How long will the data be stored?</h3>
        <p>The data will be stored for as long as the individual has the application installed on their phone. When the user decides to uninstall the application, all associated data will be deleted.The storage of the data by anyone that the participant has consciously shared with their data is not within our control and is not our responsibility.</p>

        <h3>What rights does the data participant have?</h3>
        <p>If used as part of scientific research, a participant should be informed regarding the nature of the research in line with standard ethical procedures. Similarly, participants should have been informed by researchers directly regarding how sent data will be processed and/or shared. The application will provide permanent written and icon based notifications to remind users that data is being collected. The application provides participants ability to access their own data. Participants can withdraw at any point by simply uninstalling the application, which also deletes all subsequent data.</p>

        <h3>Who should I contact if I have problems associated with data collection?</h3>
        <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:h.shaw5@lancaster.ac.uk">h.shaw5@lancaster.ac.uk</a> if you have any further questions or suggestions regarding the functionality of this application.</p>
