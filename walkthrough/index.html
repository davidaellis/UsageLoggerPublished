                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Usage logger is an Android app that records or extracts data about how a
                        person uses their smartphone. Primarily developed to assist with
                        psychological research and behavioural science more generally, the app
                        can be customised to perform a number of different functions. This
                        includes an ability to extract historical data about previous
                        (retrospective) usage form the previous 5 days.

                    <p>The customisation website allows for the researcher to choose how the app will
                        function. There are three different data streams that may be employed
                        and altered. Additionally, the researcher can customise the order that the
                        data sources are queried.</p><p><img src="img 4 walk/custom whole.png"></p>

                    <p>The website can be found <a href="https://usage-logger-custom.netlify.app/">here</a></p>
                    <p>These instructions are repeated on the website, you can press
                        "show instructions" to see them on the page</p>

                    <h3>Customise data collection: Specify the type of data should collect</h3>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/custom custom.png"></p>

                    <h4>Contextual data</h4>
                    <p>Contextual data is intended to provide the researcher with a better understanding
                        of what the smartphone can be used for at a particular point. The data collected
                        can include three difference sources of data. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apps installed - What apps are installed on the device</li>
                        <li>Permissions requested  - What permissions have been requested by which apps.
                            Permissions provide access to particular restricted data like phone call
                            logs or location. See <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</li>
                        <li>Response to permission request - Has the user provided the permission or not.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Past usage</h4>
                    <p>The will provide a database of what the person has used their phone for
                        during the last couple of days (max 5 days ago). As this database is
                        maintained by Android, it is difficult to provide much filtering at this
                        stage.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Continuous logging</h4>

                    <p>Continuous logging will record how the participants use their smartphones
                        in the future. There are a number of features which can be included in the
                        data recording.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Phone usage - record when the phone was on/off.</li>
                        <li>Screen usage - record when the screen was on/off.</li>
                        <li>app usage - record at what point apps were used and store the identity of the apps.</li>
                        <li>Notifications - record which apps have sent notifications.</li>
                        <li>Changes in installed apps - Record if any apps were installed/uninstalled.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Customise order</h3>
                    <p>Customise the order in which the data is collected by dragging and dropping the text on the right hand of the screen that appears after you have demonstrated that you want a piece of data collected.</p>
                    <p>If you have fully populated the forms in the website, it might look something like this.</p><p><img src="img 4 walk/custom pop.png"></p>

                    <h3>When you're finished</h3>
                    <p>When you're done please press on the 'finished' button. This will generate a
                        QR code, this is necessary so that we can efficently relay how you customised
                        the app to the participants in the study. You participants will have to scan
                        the QR code using usage logger in order to collect any data, data collection
                        will not start if you do not scan via the usage logger app. Additionally, you
                        can save the QR code by pressing the 'save QR' button. </p>
                    <p>This QR code will be scanned by the app and this will inform the app how it
                        should function.</p>

                    <h2 id="App">App</h2>
                    <p>The app can be found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=geyerk.sensorlab.suselogger">here</a>
                        and should look something like below</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/App home.png"></p>
                    <p>All participants will need to install this app by going to page in the google
                        play store pressing install. When opening the app it should look like this.</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/home.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;" ></p>
                    <p>The participant will be informed that this app is only intended for scientific
                        research.</p>
                    <p>Then the phone will request access to the camera permission. This is essential
                        to scan the QR code. </p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/camera perm.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>What appears next will be dependent on the type of phone that the participant
                        has, newer phones will ask if permission should only be granted this time or
                        every time when using this app; either is acceptable. Afterwards participants
                        will be asked to press the read QR code button to scan the QR code required
                        (produced by the customisation website; see above).</p>
                    <p>After the QR code is scanned, it will inform the participant again that this
                        is only intended for use for scientific research</p>
                    <p>Then the participant will receive a message about what data will be collected
                        by the app</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/instructions.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>Another message will appear describing the data security to the participant.
                        For a detailed guide of the security please see the preprint.</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/data security.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>The participant will be informed about all the permission that is required to
                        carry out the data collection. This will be either Usage permission or
                        notification listing permission or both. </p><p>A password will then appear.
                    This can be seen again at any point when the participant presses on the
                    "See password" button.</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/password.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>

                    <h2>Permissions</h2>
                    <p>We will then have to accept all the permissions involved:</p>

                    <h3>Notification permission</h3>
                    <p>For the notification permission, the participant will initially informed what is involved.</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/req note perm.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>Then they will have to select from the apps that request the permission notification logger</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/notification access.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>On selecting usage logger, a screen like this or something similar should appear</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/notification access 2.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>The participant will then come into a screen where they only see a checkbox
                        that say "Allow notification access". </p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/notification access 3.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>A warning message will appear from Android informing of all the potential
                        security problems that emerge as a result. While, this permission provides
                        wide ranging capabilities, this app only record which app is providing
                        notifications and when.</p>
                    <p>After the participant enables this permission they will return to the app,
                        if they press back.<b> Please do not exit the app to the home screen</b>
                        this may interfere with the running of the app. Instead, just press back
                        after you have accepted this permission</p>

                    <h3>Usage permission</h3>
                    <p>When back at the app, if the participant is required to give the usage
                        permission (which allows for monitoring of the app usage) they will see a
                        pop up (like below) asking them to provide usage permission. If usage
                        permission usage is not required then the app will simply start working
                        (described below).</p>
                    <p>The usage access permission works in a very similar fashion as notification
                        permission. The participants will initially given a message about what
                        permission is required and what it is used for. </p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/req use perm.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>Then the participant will have to click on Usage Logger from the list of apps
                        that want this permission. And then click on permit usage access. No
                        message will appear on doing this.</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/usage perm 2.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>After the participant enables this permission they will return to the app,
                        if they press back.<b> Please do not exit the app to the home screen</b>
                        this may interfere with the running of the app. Instead, just press back
                        after you have accepted this permission</p>

                    <h3>Running of the app</h3>
                    <p>Because of the customisation website output (see above), the app will
                        collect contextual data, then usage data and finally initiate contextual
                        logging. As a result, the app very quickly recorded the context and past
                        usage. Messages may quickly appear in the background about what is being
                        recorded but this will only last for a second or so. </p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/past usage data collect.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>If the app had been customised to perform the continual logging of smartphone
                        usage then the app would start doing this. When the participant presses
                        next steps, continual recording stops and the rest of the data is collected. </p>
                    <p>When the participant sees a screen denoting that "Status: Phone usage
                        monitoring ongoing". Then the data is being collected in the background.
                        There is also a notification in the status bar which informs the participant
                        that data is being collected in the background. </p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/continual monitor.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>When the data collecting is finished, the participant should press the
                        "next step" button and a popup will inform them the final stage is to send
                        the email to the researcher and do they wish to proceed? If they click OK,
                        they will be asked to select an app to supply the encrypted pdf to. We
                        recommend Gmail.</p>
                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/send email.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>

                    <p><img src="img 4 walk/app/supply to app.png" style="width: 225px; height: 500px;"></p>
                    <p>These are various apps that can be shared with but we have only tested with gmail.</p>
                    <p>The participant needs to communicate the password with the researcher. This
                        should not be done via gmail or some other platform that is also used to send
                        the data. If that method of communication is comprised then the participant's
                        data is quite possibly reported. We recommend using Qualtrics, MTurk or some
                        other platform used to securely record the response for questionnaires. </p>

                    <p>At this point, the data has been collected and exported to the researcher and it needs to
                        be decrypted. While, you can open the file then enter the password and have access to the
                        pdf table. The pdf table format of the data is not easy to analyse, it needs to be converted
                        into a csv or other format. Various R and python packages that are employed can be used.
                        But the packages don't seem to function well with the usage logger output. This is because
                        those packages typically do not pay attention to the cell division and instead focus on what
                        is on the same line. Therefore, if a long app name requires two lines then half of the name
                        may be entered into a different row and therefore, it can be double-counted. </p>
                    <p>This website, handles the decryption process specifically for the output of usage logger to
                        avoid such errors. We strongly advise that you use it to decrypt your data</p>

                    <p>To decrypt the data that you have collected from usage logger simply click on 'select PDF'
                        button, if you have chosen a pdf file then you will be transported to a screen where
                        you will be asked to insert a password. Please supply the associated password, after this
                        process is complete you should automatically have a csv file dropped into your folder with
                        the cleaned data. It will have the same name as the file which you have supplied it. </p>
